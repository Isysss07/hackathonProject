        <h2>Blight In Detroit</h2>
        <p>I lived in many neighborhoods with urban blight, across the street there is an abandoned burned house. There are at least 5 abandoned houses just on my block. Some of the houses are being demolished but that just leaves an empty patch in our neighborhood. Urban blight is a huge issue in Detroit and it needs to be fixed immediately.</p>
        <p>Urban blight is seen in most places in detroit. The New York Times did a survey on properties in Detroit, out of the 377,602 properties surveyed 84,641 were blighted. Detroit is a relatively poor city, because a lot of the city is blighted so people don't want to live here. About 72% of Detroit is blighted.. There are too many buildings listed to be torn down.</p>
        <p>Demolishing buildings has become the solution to urban blight in most cases. But that doesnt help the community. Instead of destroying the buildings they should rebuild them. Rebuilding the community will help with the image and you won't have to buy the material to completely start over. Fixing the community would be beneficial to everyone.</p>
