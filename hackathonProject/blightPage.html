      <h1>Urban Blight In Detroit</h1>
      
      <div class="container">
      <p>I lived in many neighborhoods with urban blight, across the street there is an abandoned burned house. There are at least 5 abandoned houses just on my block. Some of the houses are being demolished but that just leaves an empty patch in our neighborhood. Urban blight is a huge issue in Detroit and it needs to be fixed immediately.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
      <p>Urban blight is seen in most places in detroit. The New York Times did a survey on properties in Detroit, out of the 377,602 properties surveyed 84,641 were blighted. Detroit is a relatively poor city, because a lot of the city is blighted so people don't want to live here. About 72% of Detroit is blighted.. There are too many buildings listed to be torn down.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
      <p>Demolishing buildings has become the solution to urban blight in most cases. But that doesnt help the community. Instead of destroying the buildings they should rebuild them. Rebuilding the community will help with the image and you won't have to buy the material to completely start over. Fixing the community would be beneficial to everyone.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
      <p>This website will help fix the problem, but we need your help. If you volunteer you will get tax or high school credits. We just need a few volunteers to rebuilded some blighted neighborhoods so Detroit can be seen as beautiful. Just take a few hours out of your day to help fix the neighborhoods. We will set up dates to go fix the neighborhoods. Also rebuilding neighborhoods would raise property values.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="container">
      <p>Or if you don't have time a few donations would be deeply appreciated. You could help provide lunches to the volunteers, buy materials, or send money straight to our source. Any donations will be appreciated. </p>
